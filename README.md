# AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)

AI-DLC is an intelligent software development workflow that adapts to your needs, maintains quality standards, and keeps you in control of the process. For learning more about AI-DLC Methodology, read this [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/ai-driven-development-life-cycle/) and the [Method Definition Paper](https://prod.d13rzhkk8cj2z0.amplifyapp.com/) referred in it.

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release zip from the [Releases page](../../releases/latest).
2. Extract the zip. It contains an `aidlc-rules/` folder with two subdirectories:
   - `aws-aidlc-rules/` — the core AI-DLC workflow rules
   - `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` — supporting documents referenced by the rules
3. Copy both folders into your project, following the setup for your platform below.



## Kiro

AI-DLC uses [Kiro Steering Files](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/steering/) within your project workspace. Copy the rules into your project's `.kiro` folder:

1. Create the directories `.kiro/steering` and `.kiro/aws-aidlc-rule-details` in your project root.
2. Copy `aws-aidlc-rules/` into `.kiro/steering/`.
3. Copy `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` into `.kiro/`.

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
mkdir -p .kiro/steering
cp -R aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rules .kiro/steering/
cp -R aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rule-details .kiro/
```

Your project should look like:
```
<project-root>/
    ├── .kiro/
    │     ├── steering/
    │     │      ├── aws-aidlc-rules/
    │     ├── aws-aidlc-rule-details/
```

To verify the rules are loaded:

### Kiro IDE 

Open the steering files panel and confirm you see an entry for `core-workflow` under `Workspace` as shown in the screenshot below.

We use Kiro IDE in Vibe mode to run the AI-DLC workflow. This ensures that AI-DLC workflow guides the development workflow in Kiro. At times, Kiro may nudge you to switch to spec mode. Select `No` to such prompts to stay in Vibe mode.

### Kiro CLI
Run `kiro-cli`, then `/context show`, and confirm entries for `.kiro/steering/aws-aidlc-rules`.

## Amazon Q Developer IDE Plugin/Extension

AI-DLC uses [Amazon Q Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/context-project-rules.html) within your project workspace. Copy the rules into your project's `.amazonq` folder:

1. Create the directories `.amazonq/rules` and `.amazonq/aws-aidlc-rule-details` in your project root.
2. Copy `aws-aidlc-rules/` into `.amazonq/rules/`.
3. Copy `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` into `.amazonq/`.

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
mkdir -p .amazonq/rules
cp -R aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rules .amazonq/rules/
cp -R aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rule-details .amazonq/
```

Your project should look like:
```
<project-root>/
    ├── .amazonq/
    │     ├── rules/
    │     │     ├── aws-aidlc-rules/
    │     ├── aws-aidlc-rule-details/
```

To verify the rules are loaded:

1. In the Amazon Q Chat window, click the `Rules` button in the lower right corner.
2. Confirm you see entries for `.amazonq/rules/aws-aidlc-rules`.

### Other Agents

AI-DLC works with any coding agent that supports project-level rules or steering files. The general approach:

1. Place `aws-aidlc-rules/` wherever your agent reads project rules from (consult your agent's documentation).
2. Place `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` at a sibling level so the rules can reference it.

If your agent has no convention for rules files, place both folders at your project root and point the agent to `aws-aidlc-rules/` as its rules directory.

### Usage

1. Start any software development project by stating your intent starting with the phrase "Using AI-DLC, ..." in the chat. 
2. AI-DLC workflow automatically activates and guides you from there.
3. Answer structured questions that AI-DLC asks you
4. Carefully review every plan that AI generates. Provide your oversight and validation.
5. Review the execution plan to see which stages will run
6. Carefully review the artifacts and approve each stage to maintain control
7. All the artifacts will be generated in the `aidlc-docs/` directory

## Three-Phase Adaptive Workflow

AI-DLC follows a structured three-phase approach that adapts to your project's complexity:

- **🔵 INCEPTION PHASE**: Determines **WHAT** to build and **WHY**
  - Requirements analysis and validation
  - User story creation (when applicable)
  - Application Design and creating units of work for parallel development
  - Risk assessment and complexity evaluation

- **🟢 CONSTRUCTION PHASE**: Determines **HOW** to build it
  - Detailed component design
  - Code generation and implementation
  - Build configuration and testing strategies
  - Quality assurance and validation

- **🟡 OPERATIONS PHASE**: Deployment and monitoring (future)
  - Deployment automation and infrastructure
  - Monitoring and observability setup
  - Production readiness validation

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Only executes stages that add value to your specific request
- **Context-Aware**: Analyzes existing codebase and complexity requirements
- **Risk-Based**: Complex changes get comprehensive treatment, simple changes stay efficient
- **Question-Driven**: Structured multiple-choice questions in files, not chat
- **Always in Control**: Review execution plans and approve each phase

## Prerequisites

Have one of our supported platforms/tools for Assisted AI Coding installed:

- [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/)
- [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/cli/)
- [Amazon Q Developer IDE plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-in-IDE.html)

## Tenets

These are our core principles to guide our decision making.

- **No duplication**. The source of truth lives in one place. If we add support for new tools or formats that require specific files, we generate them from the source rather than maintaining separate copies.

- **Methodology first**. AI-DLC is fundamentally a methodology, not a tool. Users shouldn't need to install anything to get started. That said, we're open to convenience tooling (scripts, CLIs) down the road if it helps users adopt or extend the methodology.

- **Reproducible**. Rules should be clear enough that different models produce similar outcomes. We know models behave differently, but the methodology should minimize variance through explicit guidance.

- **Agnostic**. The methodology works with any IDE, agent, or model. We don't tie ourselves to specific tools or vendors.

- **Human in the loop**. Critical decisions require explicit user confirmation. The agent proposes, the human approves.
