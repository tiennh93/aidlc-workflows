## Tenets

These are our core principles to guide our decision making.

- **No duplication**. The source of truth lives in one place. If we add support for new tools or formats that require specific files, we generate them from the source rather than maintaining separate copies.

- **Methodology first**. AI-DLC is fundamentally a methodology, not a tool. Users shouldn't need to install anything to get started. That said, we're open to convenience tooling (scripts, CLIs) down the road if it helps users adopt or extend the methodology.

- **Reproducible**. Rules should be clear enough that different models produce similar outcomes. We know models behave differently, but the methodology should minimize variance through explicit guidance.

- **Agnostic**. The methodology works with any IDE, agent, or model. We don't tie ourselves to specific tools or vendors.

- **Human in the loop**. Critical decisions require explicit user confirmation. The agent proposes, the human approves.

## Prerequisites

Have one of our supported platforms/tools for Assisted AI Coding installed:

| Platform | Installation Link |
|----------|------------------|
| Kiro | [Install](https://kiro.dev/) |
| Kiro CLI | [Install](https://kiro.dev/cli/) |
| Amazon Q Developer IDE Plugin | [Install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-in-IDE.html) |
| Cursor IDE | [Install](https://cursor.com/) |
| Cline VS Code Extension | [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) |
| Claude Code CLI | [Install](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) |
| GitHub Copilot | [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) + [Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) |


---

## Get the AIDLC

### From Packaged Zip

1. Download the latest release zip (e.g., `ai-dlc-rules-v1.0.0.zip`) from the [Releases page](../../releases/latest) to a folder **outside** your project directory (e.g., `~/Downloads`).
2. Extract the zip. It contains an `aidlc-rules/` folder with two subdirectories:
   - `aws-aidlc-rules/` — the core AI-DLC workflow rules
   - `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` — supporting documents referenced by the rules
3. Note the path to the extracted `aidlc-rules/` folder — you'll need it in the platform-specific setup commands below.

> **Tip**: Download the **release artifact** (named `ai-dlc-rules-vX.X.X.zip`), not the auto-generated "Source code" archive. The release artifact contains `aidlc-rules/` directly, while the source archive wraps everything in an extra directory.

---

### Clone from Repository

#### Step 1: Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Project Folder

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
mkdir <my-project>
cd <my-project>
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Name "<my-project>"
Set-Location "<my-project>"
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
mkdir <my-project>
cd <my-project>
```

#### Step 3: Follow Platform-Specific Setup

Choose your platform below and follow the setup instructions.

---

## Platform-Specific Setup

  - [Amazon Q Developer IDE Plugin](#amazon-q-developer-ide-pluginextension)
  - [Kiro CLI](#kiro-cli-formerly-amazon-q-cli)
  - [Cursor IDE](#cursor-ide)
  - [Cline](#cline)
  - [Claude Code](#claude-code)
  - [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot)


> **ZIP users**: The commands below use `../aidlc-workflows/aidlc-rules` (Unix) and `..\aidlc-workflows\aidlc-rules` (Windows) as the source path, which assumes the **clone** layout. If you downloaded the **ZIP**, replace that path with the location of your extracted `aidlc-rules` folder (e.g., `~/Downloads/aidlc-rules` or `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\aidlc-rules`).

---

### Amazon Q Developer IDE Plugin/Extension

AI-DLC uses [Amazon Q Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/context-project-rules.html) to implement its intelligent workflow.

1. Start any software development project by stating your intent starting with the phrase **"Using AI-DLC, ..."** in the chat
2. AI-DLC workflow automatically activates and guides you from there
3. Answer structured questions that AI-DLC asks you
4. Carefully review every plan that AI generates. Provide your oversight and validation
5. Review the execution plan to see which stages will run
6. Carefully review the artifacts and approve each stage to maintain control
7. All the artifacts will be generated in the `aidlc-docs/` directory

---

## Three-Phase Adaptive Workflow

AI-DLC follows a structured three-phase approach that adapts to your project's complexity:

### 🔵 INCEPTION PHASE
Determines **WHAT** to build and **WHY**
- Requirements analysis and validation
- User story creation (when applicable)
- Application Design and creating units of work for parallel development
- Risk assessment and complexity evaluation

### 🟢 CONSTRUCTION PHASE
Determines **HOW** to build it
- Detailed component design
- Code generation and implementation
- Build configuration and testing strategies
- Quality assurance and validation

### 🟡 OPERATIONS PHASE
Deployment and monitoring (future)
- Deployment automation and infrastructure
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Production readiness validation

---

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Adaptive Intelligence** | Only executes stages that add value to your specific request |
| **Context-Aware** | Analyzes existing codebase and complexity requirements |
| **Risk-Based** | Complex changes get comprehensive treatment, simple changes stay efficient |
| **Question-Driven** | Structured multiple-choice questions in files, not chat |
| **Always in Control** | Review execution plans and approve each phase |

---

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Rules not loading | Check file exists in the correct location for your platform |
| File encoding issues | Ensure files are UTF-8 encoded |
| Rules not applied in session | Start a new chat session after file changes |
| Rule details not loading | Verify `.aidlc-rule-details/` exists with subdirectories |

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Amazon Q Developer / Kiro CLI
- Use `/context show` to verify rules are loaded
- Check `.amazonq/rules/` or `.kiro/steering/` directory structure

#### Cursor
- For "Apply Intelligently", ensure a description is defined in frontmatter
- Check **Cursor Settings → Rules** to ensure the rule is enabled
- If rule is too large (>500 lines), split into multiple focused rules

#### Cline
- Check the Rules popover under the chat input field
- Toggle rule files on/off as needed using the popover UI

#### Claude Code
- Use `/config` command to view current configuration
- Ask "What instructions are currently active in this project?"

#### GitHub Copilot
- Use `#file <path>` syntax to reference instruction files
- For large instructions, reference specific rule detail files instead of pasting everything

### File Path Issues on Windows
- Use forward slashes `/` in file paths within markdown files
- Windows paths with backslashes may not work correctly

---
